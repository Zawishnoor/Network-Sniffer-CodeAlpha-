A network packet sniffer, also known as a packet analyzer or protocol analyzer, is a tool used to capture and examine data packets transmitted over a computer netwo
rk.It works by intercepting and recording network traffic, allowing you to inspect the contents of individual packets.
 This information can be invaluable for:   
Network troubleshooting: Identifying performance bottlenecks or error sources.   
Security analysis: Detecting malicious activity or vulnerabilities.   
Protocol analysis: Understanding how network protocols function.   
Application development: Debugging network-related issues in applications.
